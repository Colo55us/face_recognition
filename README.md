Face Recognition using convolution neural network

OS - Windows 10
Python - 3.6
Keras - 2.0.8
tensorflow(gpu version)- 1.4
cuDNN - 6.0
cuda - 8.0


This is python face recognition program using convolutional neural network it can detect faces from front and even from side.

Steps:-
1) Run the 'populate_database.py' first but remember to run it only once. (Run it for atleast 4-5mins with different facial expression) 
2) Then run train.py. It will take some time to train the model and a file name 'model.hdf5' should appear in the repository.
3) Finally run face_recog.py and it should detect your face. :)

p.s. feel free to play with code especially train.py file

In future, will upload file to graphically view how your model is performing.
